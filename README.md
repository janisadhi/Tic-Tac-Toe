This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It can be played between two players on the same machine. The game will check for a winner after each move and declare the winner if there is one. If all positions are filled and there is no winner, it will declare the game as a draw.

## Features

## How to Play

- The game is played by two players. Player 1 uses `X`, and Player 2 uses `O`.
- Players take turns to place their mark on the 3x3 grid.
- The first player to align three marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.
- If all positions are filled and no one wins, the game will declare a draw.
